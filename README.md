# Bioinformatics, Programming Course

This repository contains the course material and exercises of "Bioinformatics, Programming Course" lectured in the academic year 2018-2019.

## Course content

Biopython will be used throughout the course to learn how biological data and bioinformatics methods can be handled programmatically. The course roughly follows the Biopython tutorial that is available at http://biopython.org/DIST/docs/tutorial/Tutorial.pdf (PDF) and http://biopython.org/DIST/docs/tutorial/Tutorial.html (HTML). The tutorial will be your primary source of information, and the Jupyter notebooks in this repository provide additional information on the topics. The notebooks also describe which sections of the tutorial are relevant in this course. The course covers the following weekly topics (corresponding chapters of the tutorial in parentheses):

#### 1. Biological sequences (chapter 3)
- sequences
- sequence alphabets
- codon tables

#### 2. Sequence records (chapters 4, 5, and 9)
- sequence records
- sequence features
- feature locations
- interface to Entrez databases

#### 3. Sequence records, part 2
- interface to UniProt databases
- interface to other online services
- named tuples

#### 4. Gene Ontology and BLAST (chapters 7 and 8)
- interface to Gene Ontology
- interface to NBCI BLAST

#### 5. TBA

#### 6. TBA

In addition to the learning objectives, the repository includes supplementary material that can be reviewed on-demand. The supplementary material will be extended as needed.
